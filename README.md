Connect Four Minimax AI (App and Arduino variants)

-Application of Python, C, Arduinos, DC circuitry, and skills like machine learning and artificial intelligence

-Using minimax algorithm, developed an unbeatable connect four AI 

-Created application using pygame library for user to play connect four game with AI 

-Also developed an arduino physical game variant: using an arduino, LEDs, a potentiometer, and buttons, designed a physical game board for users to still play on against the connect 4 AI

Run app by running connect_four_app.py
Run arduino by running connect_four_arduino.py

*For connect_four_arduino.py, edit 

board = ArduinoMega(" port ")

where "port" is your chosen usb port. As well, run standardPyfirmatarotocolP.
